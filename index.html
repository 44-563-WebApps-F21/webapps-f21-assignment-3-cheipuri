    <h6>My favorite place is Hollywood</h6>
    <p>

        Hollywood is home to more than <b>60 parks</b>, <b>seven golf courses</b>, <b>miles of pristine beaches</b>, and the one-of-a-kind Hollywood Beach Broadwalk, a promenade that stretches nearly 2.5 miles along the Atlantic Ocean. 
        Named one of America's Best Beach Boardwalks by Travel + Leisure magazine, this brick-paved thoroughfare hosts pedestrians, joggers, bicyclists, rollerbladers, and millions of others every year. The reason I like this place because it has full of positive vibrations.
